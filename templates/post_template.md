# Template for a post (event)

## Creating a post

Make sure the most is named correctly. The naming convention is:

`year-month-day-title.md`

an example would be:

`2023-08-10-new-post.md`.

This is important as the files are sorted by date. The two digit month and day format is required. 

In the header of this file, make sure you include the correct title and image. It is often easy to name the image with the date of the post.
