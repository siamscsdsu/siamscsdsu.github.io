<p>Last week I had the privilege of representing our chapter at the annual SIAM meeting that coincided with CSE in Spokane, Washington. I met with student and faculty chapter representatives from over 60 schools. We each shared our favorite events and learned how the SIAM community supports its chapters.</p>

<p>And because the annual meeting overlapped with the CSE conference, I was able to participate in the Broader Engagements (BE) program. BE provides access to the scientific programs available at the CSE conference, mentoring opportunities, and professional development workshops for students from underrepresented and underprivileged backgrounds. In the program, I was part of the software productivity and sustainability guided affinity group. Our mentors shared with us these two websites to help with software development:</p>

<p><a href="https://software-carpentry.org">https://software-carpentry.org</a></p>

<p><a href="https://scicomp.stackexchange.com">https://scicomp.stackexchange.com</a></p>

<p>I am grateful to have been a part of this program and highly recommend it to computational and math students at all stages in their education. If you have any questions about the conference or the BE program, please contact the chapter for more information.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Priscilla Kelly</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello SIAM Chapter Members,]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2019-03-05.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2019-03-05.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">In Case You Missed It: Spring 2019 Community Lecture</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spring-2019-lecture/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="In Case You Missed It: Spring 2019 Community Lecture" /><published>2019-02-19T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spring-2019-lecture</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spring-2019-lecture/"><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed the community lecture on Friday, February 15th, 2019, we hosted Dr. Gary Fogel from Natural Selection, Inc. Dr. Fogel has more than 25 years of experience in computationally-based drug optimization and development. He is an IEEE Fellow and has received awards from Sigma XI and other organizations for his work in predictive analytics using machine learning methods. Dr. Fogel also serves as an Adjunct Faculty with the CSRC and Aerospace Engineering department at SDSU.</p>

<p>Dr. Fogel’s talk was titled “Computational Intelligence Applications in Healthcare.” He shared his work in stem cell research which focuses on microRNA on and off patterns to predict developmental stages. The goal of this research is to direct and drive stem cell development by building networks of highly-correlated microRNAs.</p>

<p>In terms of computational drug discovery, Dr. Fogel’s company uses evolutionary algorithms, a nature-inspired method, to build a co-evolutionary game. This model optimizes a target protein evolutionary response when it’s exposed to a certain drug. Dr. Fogel’s company has been using this technique with Malaria. Given the enormous costs associated with developing and testing drugs, the co-evolutionary game models how evolution will change the Malaria protein structure to predict drug longevity and effectiveness. A proof of principle was recently demonstrated with early strains of drug-resistant Malaria.</p>

<p>Notable Question:</p>

<p>Could this technique be applied to MRSA?</p>

<p>It can work but we need a lot of information on how MRSA has developed in order to predict its evolutionary path.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you missed the community lecture on Friday, February 15th, 2019, we hosted Dr. Gary Fogel from Natural Selection, Inc.

We heard from four recently graduated students on their experience in academia, industry, and government positions.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Daniel Cuevas</strong> is a bioinformatician at Progenity, Inc. He works heavily on the R&amp;D side by setting tasks and determining their achievability. Cuevas suggests students learn more linear algebra and programming skills. For his work, understanding Bayesian analysis is key.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Martin Kandes</strong> is a computational and data science research specialist at SDSC. He manages user tickets on Comet, writes grant proposals, and runs training sessions for users. Kandes recommends parallel programming courses and multi-discipline projects that can build communication skills.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Anna Ma</strong> is a UC Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSD. As a PostDoc, her work is entirely research based. Ma suggests that students focus on statistics and probability. Take something away from every class you take. Particularly in mathematics, topics come back in unexpected ways.</p>

<p><strong>Gregory Behm</strong> is the CEO of Innovative HPC Solutions LLC and works for the DoD to support approximately 3,400 HPC users. Behm recommends that students try to learn a new tool or language every semester.</p>

<p>If you’d like to contact these alumni, please email the club so we can introduce you to them.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you missed our meeting on Friday, February 8th, 2019, we hosted our second annual alumni panel.

<p>She started at Palomar Community College, first as a business major, but that changed after a course in computer science. Kaplan transferred to UCSD and graduated with a degree in math and computer science. Through an internship, she landed her first job with GKN Aerospace. The initial internship position was for project management, but through hard work, a computer science position was created for her.</p>

<p>Kaplan’s Tips for Success:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Develop strong communication skills</li>
  <li>Show you have experience working with people</li>
  <li>Focus on what you know! Highlight your experiences.</li>
  <li>Make sure your resume is clear and straight-forward.</li>
  <li>Step out of your comfort zone!</li>
  <li>If you’d like to speak to Anna Kaplan please contact the chapter so we can introduce her to you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notable Questions for Kaplan:</p>

<p><em>What do you work on day-to-day?</em></p>

<p>I work on a team that builds software ranging from finance to engineering processes.</p>

<p><em>Is there room to grow from where you are?</em></p>

<p>There is room to grow at GA. I talked to HR to get approval for my Master’s certificate program and I’m thankful that I have this great opportunity to further my education.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you missed our meeting on Thursday, November 19th, 2018, we hosted Anna Kaplan, Full Stack Developer at General Atomics.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2018-11-30.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2018-11-30.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">In Case You Missed It: Inside the Life–Northrop Grumman</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/northrop-grumman/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="In Case You Missed It: Inside the Life–Northrop Grumman" /><published>2018-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/northrop-grumman</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/northrop-grumman/"><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed our meeting on Wednesday, November 7th, 2018, we hosted Catherine Meyn, Corporate Director of Programs at Northrop Grumman.</p>

<p>Her career path started with software engineering for a defense contractor. She moved to program then department manager and left to be an executive in commercial startups. Meyn came to Northrop Grumman as a business development manager and moved up to her current position.</p>

<p>Her biggest tip for success is that YOU must promote yourself.</p>

<p>Fear is a barrier to success
No one knows everything, nor are you expected to
Look for jobs that stretch you
Don’t be afraid of being told no
Culture is equally as important as salary
Large companies, like Northrop Grumman, get over a thousand resumes for each entry-level job. You need to set yourself apart. Meyn suggested that you consider yourself the product. Create the roadmap to where you want to be, then work to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>When it comes to the interview, do your homework! Research the company, read up on the other job openings, know what they are working on. Showing that you care about the company tells them you are the total package, but, you also must know what your deal-breakers are. Be firm, but not negative, and always be willing to negotiate.</p>

<p>Meyn emphasized that the hard work doesn’t end once you’ve landed the job. Be visible in the company, find and BE a mentor, tell your boss what you want from your career. Don’t cut yourself out of any opportunity because you don’t fit all the requirements, no one expects you to know everything.</p>

<p>Meyn then introduced us to Northrop Grumman. They are leaders in cybersecurity, communications, sensors, health analytics, aircraft, and spacecraft development. They have centers all around the United States, and, if you are interested in staying in San Diego, they have a lot of software development groups here.</p>

<p>If you’d like to speak with Catherine Meyn please contact the chapter so we can introduce her to you.</p>

<p>Notable Questions for Meyn:</p>

<p><em>How can an applied math major tailor their resume to an engineering job?</em></p>

<p>Strong math skills are needed in every department. Read up on the types of projects they are working on and rephrase your experience in those terms.</p>

<p><em>What project was most personal to you?</em></p>

<p>The development of 24/7 wifi communications between soldiers and their loved ones on shore.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you missed our meeting on Wednesday, November 7th, 2018, we hosted Catherine Meyn, Corporate Director of Programs at Northrop Grumman.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2018-11-02.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2018-11-02.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
