### Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematicians (SIAM) Student Chapter (SC) at San Diego State University (SDSU)

The SIAM SC at SDSU exists to ensure strong communications between student and professional communities through invited talks, site visits, and conferences.

Listed below are the intended activities and goals for the San Diego State University Student Chapter:

- To provide perspective at both the undergraduate and graduate level on how is Mathematics being applied across many disciplines, including Computational Science and Engineering.
- Organizing meetings on a regular basis to involve faculty and student members across San Diego State University campus to promote interdisciplinary collaboration.
- Inviting (domestic and international) speakers to give talks on interdisciplinary research frontiers and career development.
- Organizing field trips to research institutions and industrial corporations to give graduate and undergraduate students experiences on how mathematics can be applied across disciplines.
- Facilitate student success at the Applied Computational Science and Engineering Student Support (ACSESS) poster event, which provides U.S. industries and CSRC partners to network with computational students.
