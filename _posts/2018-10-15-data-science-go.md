The SIAM Chapter was invited to attend this yearâ€™s second annual data science conference, hosted by **Kirill Eremenko**, in La Jolla, California this last weekend. Data Science Go 2018 (DSGo) was a big success with more than 400 attendees and representatives from 23 countries.

DSGo aims to welcome newcomers to the data science world and connect professionals with companies all over the world. The event had over 34 sessions and 25 speakers with topics that ranged from the technical sides of data science to how you can grow your career.

The organizers provided our club discounted tickets and plan to again next year!
