In case you missed our meeting on Friday, February 8th, 2019, we hosted our second annual alumni panel. We heard from four recently graduated students on their experience in academia, industry, and government positions.

**Dr. Daniel Cuevas** is a bioinformatician at Progenity, Inc. He works heavily on the R&D side by setting tasks and determining their achievability. Cuevas suggests students learn more linear algebra and programming skills. For his work, understanding Bayesian analysis is key.

**Dr. Martin Kandes** is a computational and data science research specialist at SDSC. He manages user tickets on Comet, writes grant proposals, and runs training sessions for users. Kandes recommends parallel programming courses and multi-discipline projects that can build communication skills.

**Dr. Anna Ma** is a UC Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSD. As a PostDoc, her work is entirely research based. Ma suggests that students focus on statistics and probability. Take something away from every class you take. Particularly in mathematics, topics come back in unexpected ways.

**Gregory Behm** is the CEO of Innovative HPC Solutions LLC and works for the DoD to support approximately 3,400 HPC users. Behm recommends that students try to learn a new tool or language every semester.

If you’d like to contact these alumni, please email the club so we can introduce you to them.
