Please join SIAM Student Chapter, SDSU for our October Journal Club! We will be discussing an interesting perspective paper from _SIAM News_ on Graph Neural Networks and Applied Linear Algebra. Come for the discussion, to chat to fellow students, and for the free pizza - first come, first serve!

If you are interested in attending, please let a SIAM Executive Board member know at the next journal club and ask us if you have any questions - remember, there are limited spots!
