Please join SIAM Student Chapter, SDSU for our November Journal Club! We will be discussing a recent SIAM news article on how mathematics can help patients with burn injuries. It is an interesting (and quick!) SIAM article how important mathematics can be to drive the health sciences. Come for the discussion, to chat to fellow students, and for the free pizza (first come, first serve)!
