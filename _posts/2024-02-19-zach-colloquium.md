Please join the SDSU SIAM Chapter for a colloquium talk from Zach Weinersmith. Zach will be chatting about his new book **A City on Mars** where we will learn all about what it would be like to love in space. Come for fun, snacks, and coffee!

- __Date__:   February 23, 2024
- __Time__:   3:30-4:30 p.m.
- __Place__:  GMCS 314
- __Speaker__:  Zach Weinersmith, SMBC Comics

In this talk, we discuss our new book A City on Mars, which summarizes four years of weird research in an attempt to answer this question - everything from planetary geology to sex in space to the legal theory of off-world state creation, and much more.
