Several members of the **SIAM Student Chapter at SDSU** will be attending the **Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) 2026**, one of the largest international conferences in mathematics. We would like to wish them the best of luck as they prepare to represent our chapter, network with researchers, and explore new academic and professional opportunities.

The **JMM 2026** will take place in **Washington, DC**, bringing together students, faculty, and industry professionals from around the world to share ideas, attend talks, and build collaborations.


### Event Information
- __Travel Dates__: January 3–7, 2026
