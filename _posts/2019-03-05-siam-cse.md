Hello SIAM Chapter Members,

Last week I had the privilege of representing our chapter at the annual SIAM meeting that coincided with CSE in Spokane, Washington. I met with student and faculty chapter representatives from over 60 schools. We each shared our favorite events and learned how the SIAM community supports its chapters.

And because the annual meeting overlapped with the CSE conference, I was able to participate in the Broader Engagements (BE) program. BE provides access to the scientific programs available at the CSE conference, mentoring opportunities, and professional development workshops for students from underrepresented and underprivileged backgrounds. In the program, I was part of the software productivity and sustainability guided affinity group. Our mentors shared with us these two websites to help with software development:

[https://software-carpentry.org](https://software-carpentry.org)

[https://scicomp.stackexchange.com](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com)

I am grateful to have been a part of this program and highly recommend it to computational and math students at all stages in their education. If you have any questions about the conference or the BE program, please contact the chapter for more information.

Sincerely,

Priscilla Kelly
