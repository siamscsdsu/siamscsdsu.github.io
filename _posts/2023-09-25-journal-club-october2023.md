Spooky season is starting!! Please join SIAM Student Chapter, SDSU for our spooky October Journal Club to kick-off the spooky season! We will be discussing a recent SIAM news article on predicting hurricane trajectories using mathematics and computational science. It is an interesting (and quick!) SIAM article on the differences between classical statistical modeling and cotemporary machine learning. Come for the discussion, to chat to fellow students, and for the free pizza (first come, first serve)!

- __Date__:   October 5th, 2023
