In case you missed our meeting on Thursday, November 19th, 2018, we hosted **Anna Kaplan**, Full Stack Developer at General Atomics.

She started at Palomar Community College, first as a business major, but that changed after a course in computer science. Kaplan transferred to UCSD and graduated with a degree in math and computer science. Through an internship, she landed her first job with GKN Aerospace. The initial internship position was for project management, but through hard work, a computer science position was created for her.

Kaplan’s Tips for Success:

1. Develop strong communication skills
2. Show you have experience working with people
3. Focus on what you know! Highlight your experiences.
4. Make sure your resume is clear and straight-forward.
5. Step out of your comfort zone!
6. If you’d like to speak to Anna Kaplan please contact the chapter so we can introduce her to you.

Notable Questions for Kaplan:

_What do you work on day-to-day?_

I work on a team that builds software ranging from finance to engineering processes.

_Is there room to grow from where you are?_

There is room to grow at GA. I talked to HR to get approval for my Master’s certificate program and I’m thankful that I have this great opportunity to further my education.
