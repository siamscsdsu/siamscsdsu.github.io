Please join SIAM Student Chapter, SDSU for our April Journal Club! We will be discussing an interesting perspective paper from _SIAM News_ on Understanding Uncertainty in Glacier Models â€” Before the Ice Melts. Come for the discussion, to chat to fellow students, and for the free pizza - first come, first serve!

__IMPORTANT:__ We will also be discussing elections for the next year. If you or someone you know is interested in running for an executive board position, please come for an overview of the process or more information! We are looking forward to welcoming the new executive board for the 2025-2026 school year. The interest form is [now available](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCofL8mAIXiBL_mICNpw9w7Kx_ZdfPZRvEZBnh99ycYxfw2w/viewform?usp=dialog)!
