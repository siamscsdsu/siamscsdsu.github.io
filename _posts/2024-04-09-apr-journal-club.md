Please join SIAM Student Chapter, SDSU for our April Journal Club! We will be discussing a recent SIAM news article on Fusing Artificial Intelligence and Optimization with Trustworthy Optimization Proxies. It is an interesting (and quick!) SIAM News article. Come for the discussion, to chat to fellow students, and for the free pizza (first come, first serve)!

__IMPORTANT:__ We will also be discussing elections for the next year. If you or someone you know is interested in running for an executive board position, please come for an overview of the process or more information! We are looking forward to welcoming the new executive board for the 2024-2025 school year.
