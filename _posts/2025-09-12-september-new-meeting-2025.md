Based on conversations from our first meeting, we’re moving to a **twice-monthly (biweekly)** cadence. **Journal Club** will continue on the **first Thursday** of each month. On the **third Thursday**, we’ll host an activity night (e.g., guest speakers, collaborations with other organizations, etc.).

**Next week** will be a general information meeting. We’ll go over our chapter’s annual trip to the **Joint Mathematics Meetings** and other updates.

- __Date__:   September 18, 2025
- __Time__:   6 p.m.

We’ll also send out a Google Form next week to vote for **Secretary**—please keep an eye out. If you applied for the position and haven’t heard from us yet, **email us ASAP**.

We look forward to seeing everyone next week!
