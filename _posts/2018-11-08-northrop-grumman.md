In case you missed our meeting on Wednesday, November 7th, 2018, we hosted Catherine Meyn, Corporate Director of Programs at Northrop Grumman.

Her career path started with software engineering for a defense contractor. She moved to program then department manager and left to be an executive in commercial startups. Meyn came to Northrop Grumman as a business development manager and moved up to her current position.

Her biggest tip for success is that YOU must promote yourself.

Fear is a barrier to success
No one knows everything, nor are you expected to
Look for jobs that stretch you
Don’t be afraid of being told no
Culture is equally as important as salary
Large companies, like Northrop Grumman, get over a thousand resumes for each entry-level job. You need to set yourself apart. Meyn suggested that you consider yourself the product. Create the roadmap to where you want to be, then work to fill in the gaps.

When it comes to the interview, do your homework! Research the company, read up on the other job openings, know what they are working on. Showing that you care about the company tells them you are the total package, but, you also must know what your deal-breakers are. Be firm, but not negative, and always be willing to negotiate.

Meyn emphasized that the hard work doesn’t end once you’ve landed the job. Be visible in the company, find and BE a mentor, tell your boss what you want from your career. Don’t cut yourself out of any opportunity because you don’t fit all the requirements, no one expects you to know everything.

Meyn then introduced us to Northrop Grumman. They are leaders in cybersecurity, communications, sensors, health analytics, aircraft, and spacecraft development. They have centers all around the United States, and, if you are interested in staying in San Diego, they have a lot of software development groups here.

If you’d like to speak with Catherine Meyn please contact the chapter so we can introduce her to you.

Notable Questions for Meyn:

_How can an applied math major tailor their resume to an engineering job?_

Strong math skills are needed in every department. Read up on the types of projects they are working on and rephrase your experience in those terms.

_What project was most personal to you?_

The development of 24/7 wifi communications between soldiers and their loved ones on shore.
