It’s time to let the numbers swing for the fences, bring your best ideas and out-hit the odds.

We’re hosting a **mini competition** at this week’s meeting. On **Thursday**, we’ll provide the dataset and the rules. You’ll have **5 days** (due **Tuesday, October 21, 2025**) to submit your World Series rankings along with the **mathematical reasoning** behind your choices. The winner will receive a treat at our next **Journal Club meeting** (Thursday, November 6). We can help with any data handling/coding you need.
